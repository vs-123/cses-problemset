# CSES Problemset Solutions
This repository holds **my solutions** to the [CSES Problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
The solutions are written in C++ and are organised to make them easy to navigate and hopefully easy to understand.

## Structure
- Each solution is stored in its own standalone `.cpp` file within the `src/` directory.
- The naming convention follows the problem titles from the CSES Problemset for clarity.

## Notes
- These solutions reflect my personal approaches to the problems.
- Feel free to explore and use these as a reference!

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Use the provided `CMakeLists.txt` to build the solutions.
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```
3. The executables will be generated for each `.cpp` file present in the `src/` directory.
